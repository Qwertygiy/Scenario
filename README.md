# Scenario Module
Currently Terasology has some interest in creation of exploration worlds and games such as Light & Shadow, but there is little support built into the game, everything must be done from a developer's standpoint, this forces the only ones really able to create are designers that also have a developer background as well. The scenario module aims to eliminate this almost entirely, allowing for "static" worlds to be created and logic able to be made in the world similarly to how a game maker such as Unreal Engine or Unity would function, oftentimes at an even higher level than offered with these programs.

The scenario module's progress for this summer is detailed further in the other issues in this repository. In general the module will be built in which a tool will be accessible in game by a player who then gains access to the ability to program logic using a treeview to setup events, conditionals, and actions into their beautifully crafted world. 

The scenario module aims to achieve this editing with grace by allowing very simple navigation through the HUB tool with a large portion of the summer being focused upon user interface and interaction in hopes to achieve a very easy to use tool that will work for both single player and multiplayer editing and interaction. In addition to this simplistic navigation the scenario tool will include documentation about each interaction used in the creation of a scenario.

## Timeline

- Week 1 (May 31st - June 4th) aims to create the HUB tool and begin the creation of the module #2
- Week 2 (June 5th - 11th) will add events and actions to the HUB tool #3
- Week 3 (June 12th - 18th) will allow for logic and conditionals to be added to allow for basic scenario creation #4 
- Weeks 4 and 5 (June 19th - July 2nd) regions will be implemented for use in logic #5 #6
- Week 6 (July 3rd - 9th) is entirely focused upon navigation and user interface #7
- Week 7 (July 10th - 16th) will be focused on getting triggers to work within a multiplayer setting #8
- Weeks 8 and 9 (July 17th - 30th) will allow for editing to be done in a multiplayer setting #9 
- Week 10 and 11 (July 31st - August 13th) a large test scenario will be created as both example and a true test for the entire system #10 #11
- Week 12 (August 14th - 21st) will be the final documentation detailing each intricacy of the system #12
